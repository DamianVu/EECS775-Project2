Project 2 for EECS775: Visualization

This is my Project 2 for EECS775: Visualization at KU. 
I am currently taking this course in Spring of 2018.

## Overview

The requirements for this project is to use OpenGL geometry shaders to implement the Marching Cubes
algorithm and produce visual output of two types:

1. Nested Contour Lines
2. Nested Solid Color Regions

From class discussions, the idea behind this project is to take elevation data and generate a contour map.
This technique can be applied to other data sets as well to find interesting trends.
